# Climate Data Analysis
In this project, we analyze and explore climate data using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The data is stored in an SQLite database named "hawaii.sqlite".

## Setup
1. Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to the SQLite database.

2. Utilize automap_base() to reflect the database tables into Python classes: Station and Measurement.

3. Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

4. Remember to close your session at the end of your analysis.

## Precipitation Analysis
Perform an analysis on the precipitation data:

1. Find the most recent date in the dataset.

2. Retrieve the previous 12 months of precipitation data from that date.

3. Select only the "date" and "prcp" values.

4. Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame, setting column names explicitly.

5. Sort the DataFrame values by "date".

6. Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.

7. Print summary statistics for the precipitation data using Pandas.

## Station Analysis
Analyze the stations in the dataset:

1. Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

2. Find the most-active stations based on the number of observations.

3. List the stations and their observation counts in descending order.

4. Answer the question: which station ID has the greatest number of observations?

5. Calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperatures for the most-active station.

6. Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data for this station.

7. Plot the TOBS data as a histogram with bins=12.

8. Close the session.

# Design Your Climate App

## API Routes
- Create routes for the homepage and listing available routes.
- Route for returning a JSON representation of date and precipitation (api/v1.0/precipitation).
- Route for returning a JSON list of stations (api/v1.0/stations).
- Route for returning a JSON list of temperature observations for the most active station (api/v1.0/tobs).

## Dynamic Routes
- Route for returning temperature statistics for a specified start date (api/v1.0/<start>).
- Route for returning temperature statistics for a specified date range (api/v1.0/<start>/<end>).

## Database Connection and Setup
- Connect to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy create_engine.
- Reflect the tables using automap_base.
- Save references to the tables in the SQLite file.

## Flask App Setup
- Set up the Flask application.

## Data Routes
- Implement data retrieval and formatting for the routes.
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully.
